#R script to reproduce the final figure of my thesis:

The effect of a hard deadline – such as the end of the thesis – on the productivity of a graduate student. The y-axis shows the number of days since the start of writing to submission of each chapter. The solid black line represents an exponential fit (y = 1875×e-0.978X; R2=0.98), the green line is the current trajectory, while the red line represents the most likely scenario according to decades of experience of the scientific community, together with night-time communication with the future self.
Tribute to XKCD for a weekly source of distraction and procrastination along the PhD. Plot made with the R package “xkcd”.
